# End-to-End Telco Customer Churn Classification

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It covers all stages from data ingestion to deployment, monitoring, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** Automated data loading and cleaning.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Build, train, and evaluate classification models to predict customer churn.
- **Deployment:** Containerized with Docker and ready for deployment on AWS.
- **CI/CD:** Integrated continuous integration and deployment pipeline for robust automation.
- **Monitoring & Visualization:** Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring and business insights.
- **Exception Handling & Logging:** Robust error handling and logging for maintainability.

## Project Structure
- `Data/` — Contains the Telco-Customer-Churn.csv dataset.
- `Networksecurity/` — Source code for data processing, modeling, and utilities.
- `Dockerfile` — Containerization for deployment.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `Notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping.


*This project demonstrates a full MLOps workflow for a real-world business problem, including best practices for deployment, automation, and monitoring.*
